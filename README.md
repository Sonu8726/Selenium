Selenium Practice 

This is practicing of Selenium. 

I have completed with normal opertaion i.e 

  1. Launch Browser
  2. Number of Anchor links
  3. Number of Images 
  4. Send keys
  5. Suggestion Search
  6. Window Operation like switch window, switch tab
  7. DropDown select
  8. Select Checkbox
  9. Select Radiobutton
 10. Hide and Seek
 11. Find Fields
 12. Alert
 13. Mouse Hover
 14. Implicitly Wait (aka Implicit Wait but if you check function name you will find that its what I mentioned :-) )
 15. PageLoatTimeout means using this you can check if any app load in how many seconds like if we set 5, means app should load in 5 otherwise it will give us an error that is timeout.
 16. SetScriptTimeOut I am not sure with code but It will allows program continues if condition matches.
 17. Manage frames and back to original page
 18. Explicit Timeout wait until WebElement present or displayed
 19. Manage Actions 
 20. Double click
 21. Drag and Drop and JSExecutor
